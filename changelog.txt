//====================//
// Subtitles Mod: 2.0 //
//====================//

[New stuff]
- New scheme manager, thanks to HL:Paranoia mod team :D (It's now possible to load custom fonts with custom charsets !)
- Translations are now possible ! ( with support for non-english characters )
- Long sentences split into linked shorter ones ( Fix for walls of text )
- Chapter titles are again in-game !
- When H.E.V logon sentence is played ( when player gets HEV suit ) all scientist and security guards will stay quiet.
This will prevent breaking up HEV logon subtitles. THIS ONLY: works with random sentences ( greetings,questions,answers)
all scripted sequences (e.g. "Go right on through, sir. Looks like you're in the barrel today.") will still be played.
- Edited intro,outro credits; Mod credits + combines messages to avoid TOO_MUCH_MESSAGES error.

[Mod fixes]
- Size and position corrections
- Vertical spacing corrected
- Removed duplicated subtitles
- Fixed crash when more than 2 messages are on screen.
- Fixed crash related to "Saved..." message, yeah savegame didn't crash the game, that message did -_-'
- Many other little corrections and bug fixes 

[Half-Life 1 - related fixes]
- No more sentences SPAM, when player mash "E" like crazy. ( Friendly NPC must now finish sentence, before player will be allowed to use "E" again. )
- No more sentences SPAM when player is shooting a friendly "invincible" target. (e.g. c2a1 lying barney)
- NPCs won't interrupt each other sentences. For example on c1a0 when security guard will start his BA_DESK sentence, all other scientists in range won't say anything, until guard finish his sentence. This will prevent breaking up linked plot related dialogues with random greetings,question and answers.
