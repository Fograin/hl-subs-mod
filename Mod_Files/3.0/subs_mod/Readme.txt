// Features
////////////////
- Ingame subtitles, rendered using VGUI interface
- Different colors for different entities, it helps when multiple people/things are speaking
- Full integration with sentence system ( A.I activated voices, scripted_sentences ) and dynamic sound emitters ( ambient_generic, HEV suit voice, voice activated via animation events )
- Support for custom fonts, including custom charsets
- Translations are now possible ! ( VGUI one, interface is limited only for ANSI fonts :/ )
- A.I. fixes to prevent NPCs from spamming questions, answers and other random sentences while more important scripted_sentence is currently playing 


///////////////////////
// Known bugs so far
///////////////////////
- In VERY rare cases subtitles might go out of sync when multiple entities are speaking ( This is mostly fixed with version 2.0 and newer )
