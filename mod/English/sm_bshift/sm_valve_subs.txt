}

$holdtime 10.5
!HOLO_DUCK
{
You'll need to duck under the next set of obstacles. When you crawl in a crouch position, you can move very silently. This can be very useful when you don't want to be heard.

Keep trying, and you'll get it!
}

}

$holdtime 8.5

}

$holdtime 9.5

{
If you want to get through the target range as quickly as possible, try reloading during pauses instead of letting your gun run out of ammunition at a critical time.
}

$holdtime 8

To fire the grenade launcher, use the alternate fire button. Some targets can only be destroyed by lobbing grenades.

Your H.U.D. will let you know when oxygen becomes critical. That means you'll need to find some clean air to breath. As you swim through this course, your blood oxygen levels will begin to drop. At the midpoint, you'll be given an opportunity to surface for air.
}

$holdtime 11
!HOLO_BREATH
{
Swim up to the surface to catch your breath. You'll regain health lost from holding your breath too long once you've made it to the surface for air. Go ahead and swim on to the next section.

Some of the more promising research on the matter led to a device that could be attached to strange crystalline structures we found on this borderworld.

Now, this device, could then be used as a focal point and relay to aid in the teleportation. Well, in theory that is.

We lost contact with the survey group shortly after the device was in place. We later discovered other methods of aiming the field, but all the equipment in this lab uses the older technology.

Good job, Mr. Calhoun. We begin to worry when you didn't come back for some time, but it looks though you were able to get the device device operational. The signal we're getting is very strong, but I'm afraid I have some bad news...

The power reserves were just enough to open a field for your trip to the borderworld. If we plan on keeping the teleporter open long enough to calculate a safe exit point, and allow time for everyone to go through, someone will have to go to the lower level, and retrieve another power cell.
