FEATURES: 
- Fully integrated ingame subtitles for EVERY dialogue/sentence.
- Support for text aligment and wrapping.
- Improved fonts (Easier to read even on low resolutions)
- Different text color for different entities.
- Sound origin distance check that prevents displaying subtitles for inaudiable sounds.
- Multilanguage translations including custom language characters and diacritics.
(Due to the VGUI 1 limits, we can only use ANSI fonts and we can’t use Unicode/2Byte)
- A.I. fixes to prevent NPCs from spamming random sentences (Questions, answers, e.t.c) while more important scripted sentence is currently playing. Also the NPCs are now polite and won’t interrupt each other. (Until they will be forced to do so, e.g. scripted event)
- Miscellaneous fixes even for bugs that were present in Half-Life for years.
(Red flashlight, visible crosshair even without HEV, weapon prediction system issues e.t.c)
