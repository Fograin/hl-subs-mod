Contents:
dev_tools directory:
- some tools that are useful (HL1 bitmap font creator, GFX.wad editor etc)

Mod_Files directory:
- compiled mod binaries + all required stuff

src_3_0_stable directory
- FULL Source Code from 3.0 stable build.
THIS IS RECOMMENDED version of source code.
You can use that when developing a mod.

src_nasty directory
- Most recent up-to-date source code, in WORK IN PROGRESS phase.
You can use this code if you really wish to, but it's nasty.
This directory is full of bugs, cockroaches, hulking gargantuas and other dirty stuff.
Note: As said before it's nasty WIP code, if I hear anyone cry about "src_nasty SRC is not compiling"
I will personally bitch slap every one of you whiners - Fograin92
