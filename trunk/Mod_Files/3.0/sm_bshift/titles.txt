!HOLO_INTRO
{
$HOLO_INTROa
Hello and welcome to the Black Mesa Hazard Course, where you'll be trained in the use of the Hazardous Environment Suit.
}

$holdtime 8
HOLO_INTROa
{
I'm your holographic assistant. Let's begin by stepping into your suit ! You can see it suspended up ahead of you.
}

$holdtime 5.5
!HOLO_BUTTON
{
If you see one of these buttons, press it and I will appear to demonstrate certain moves.
}

$holdtime 15
!HOLO_MOVE
{
Moving around in your H.E.V suit can be slightly disorienting at first. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with basic movement and soon it will fit you like a second skin ! I will see you just around the corner !
}

$holdtime 4.5
!HOLO_JUMP
{
$HOLO_JUMPa
The first move we will practice in the Hazard Course, is basic jumping !
}

$holdtime 5.5
HOLO_JUMPa
{
$HOLO_JUMPb
You'll attempt to get over this set of pipes, using only your run and jump commands.
}

$holdtime 5.5
HOLO_JUMPb
{
It helps to get a running start. Watch me and then try it yourself !
}

$holdtime 10
!HOLO_DUCK
{
You will now duck under the next set of obstacles. Please note that crouching will automatically shift your suit into stealth mode, minimizing movement noise.
}

$holdtime 11
!HOLO_JDUCK
{
Now we will combine skills. You'll need to JUMP, DUCK and then JUMP again ! This will prepare you for the next room, where you'll have to do both moves at the same time.
}

$holdtime 4.5
!HOLO_PIPEDUCK
{
$HOLO_PIPEDUCKa
To get into these pipes, you'll have to signal your suit to make a duck jump.
}

$holdtime 13
HOLO_PIPEDUCKa
{
You want to stand right at the mouth of the pipe and continue to press forward. Then jump up and while are you in mid air, go into a crouch. It's tricky, but you'll find it comes in handy !
}

$holdtime 1
!HOLO_NICEJOB
{
Nice job !
}

$holdtime 7.8
!HOLO_LADDER
{
Walk directly into the ladder, look up and continue moving forward. If you want to come back down, just move backward.
}

$holdtime 13
!HOLO_3JUMPS
{
The next 3 jumps get harder each time, but they are quite possible. Don't be surprised, if you miss the last one a time or two. If you can make all 3 in a continuous run, you are doing well !
}

$holdtime 2
!HOLO_KEEPTRYING
{
Keep trying ! You'll get it !
}

$holdtime 2
!HOLO_RUNSTART
{
It helps to have a running start !
}

$holdtime 3.7
!HOLO_FALLSHORT
{
If you keep falling short, you might be jumping too soon.
}

$holdtime 4.5
!HOLO_GREATWORK
{
Great work ! Now there is one more style of jumping you need to learn.
}

$holdtime 4
!HOLO_LONGJUMP
{
$HOLO_LONGJUMPa
Long jumping requires its own charging module, seen in here.
}

$holdtime 11
HOLO_LONGJUMPa
{
To activate your long jump, you will have to duck and move forward and then launch into a jump. Once you are up on the platform press the button and I will demonstrate the move.
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_RETRY
{
Give it another try. Remember to move forward, jump and while in mid air, crouch.
}

}

$holdtime 10
!HOLO_PUSHBOX
{
What you really need to do, is push that box down into the pit. Pushing is easy ! Just move forward against the box and you can push it into position.
}

$holdtime 7.8
!HOLO_PULLBOX
