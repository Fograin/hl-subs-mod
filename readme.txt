Contents:
[archive]
- Archived versions of the source code.

[dev_tools]:
- Some tools that are useful (HL1 bitmap font creator, GFX.wad editor etc)

[Mod_Files]:
- Compiled mod binaries + all required stuff.

[src]
- Most recent up-to-date source code, in WORK IN PROGRESS phase.
You can use this code if you really wish to, but it's nasty.
This directory is full of bugs, cockroaches, hulking gargantuas and other dirty stuff.

If you're developing your own HL 1 mod with subtitles; I recommend using "src_3_0_stable" source code, you can find it inside "archive" directory.
